This covers most of the basic features of SolveSpace, including sketches, constraints, extrusions, and Boolean operations. When we first run SolveSpace, we will begin with an empty part. Initially, our view of the part will be oriented onto the XY plane; the label for that plane is displayed at the bottom left of the screen (#XY, in dark grey). The axes are also indicated by the three colored arrows at the bottom left; the X, Y, and Z axes are drawn in red, green, and blue respectively. When we hover the mouse over any entity, constraint, or other object in the sketch, that object will appear highlighted in yellow. For example, the XY plane, which is drawn as a dashed square, will appear highlighted when we hover the mouse over it. The YZ and ZX planes initially look like dashed lines, because they are being viewed on edge; but they still appear highlighted in yellow when we hold the mouse over them. It is similarly possible to highlight the X, Y, and Z axes (which are drawn as arrows), or the origin (which like all points is drawn as a green square).

Assembly (零件組立) http://solvespace.com/box.pl To start, we would like to define the orientation of the part. We can do that by locking one of the part's normals in the same orientation as one of our coordinate axes. Here, a good choice would be to constrain any of the base's normals—which are drawn as blue arrows—in the same orientation as our coordinate system's Z axis, which is also drawn as a blue arrow, in this view pointing approximately up from the origin. Select those two normals by left-clicking them, and choose Constrain → Same Orientation, or the equivalent constraint from the toolbar. The two normals are now each marked with a magenta X, which is visible above. (It doesn't matter which of the normals on the part were chosen to constrain, since they all point in the same direction. The choice is arbitrary.) This means that those two normals are constrained to point in the same direction (i.e., parallel); but it also locks the twist of the part about that axis, so it fully constrains the part's orientation. The same-orientation constraint is useful, because it completely specifies a part's orientation with a single constraint. We can try to drag the part's orientation and rotation now. We will find that it is still possible to translate the part anywhere, but impossible to rotate it, because that rotation is now fixed. To define the translation, we can use a point-coincident constraint. Select the two points marked in red in the image above, and choose Constrain → On Point. The two points will now be constrained to be coincident, locking the imported part's translation. The imported part is now fully constrained. 零件組立 零件組立 from 曾宜萱 on Vimeo .","tags":"course"},{"url":"./onshape.html","title":"onshape","text":"小組作業 1-1 from 曾宜萱 on Vimeo . 1-2 from 曾宜萱 on Vimeo . 1-3 from 曾宜萱 on Vimeo . week 11-1 from 曾宜萱 on Vimeo .","tags":"course"},{"url":"./solvespace.html","title":"solvespace","text":"零件繪製 solvespace from 曾宜萱 on Vimeo . 心得 這是最一開始畫的solvespaces,那時候對這個程式完全不認識,是看著那篇英文文章慢慢摸索如何去畫,也學到很多單字","tags":"course"},{"url":"./2016fall-ji-jie-she-ji-zhu-ti-jiao-xue.html","title":"2016Fall 機械設計主題教學","text":"知識管理與最佳化應用實驗室試圖利用計算機程式、網際內容管理、電腦輔助設計實習與協同產品設計實習等課程, 進行與機械設計相關的主題式教學, 其中包含強化創造力的教學、令學員熟習六種工程表達方式, 並且俱備融入協同設計所需要的四大面向知識與技能. 機械設計主題教學 創造力三元素, 機械設計的六種表達, 協同設計的四大面向. 強化創造能力 - 自學力、程式力與想像力 (Creative Competencies) 熟習六種表達 - 口語、文字、2D、3D、理論與實體表達 (Six Presentation Methods) 融入協同設計 - 電腦、網路、軟硬體工具與協同專案 (Collaborative Designs) 2016 Fall CADP A 分組網頁: 第1組 : 40223103 40223109 40423111 40443111 第2組 : 40423101 40423103 40423104 40423117 40423136 40423144 第3組 : 40423105 40423115 40423119 40423128 40423139 40423149 第4組 : 40423106 40423107 40423108 40423121 40423125 40423140 第5組 : 40423109 40423110 40423113 40423130 40423131 40423138 第6組 : 40423112 40423116 40423118 40423127 40423137 40423152 第7組 : 40423114 40423115 40423120 40423122 40423124 第8組 : 40423123 40423129 40423132 40423133 40423155 40423157 第9組 : 40423126 40423135 40423150 40423154 第10組 : 40423141 40423143 40423145 40423146 40423147 40423148 以下為分組資料處理程式: content = open(\"2016fall_cadp_a_groups.txt\").read() #print(content) result = content.splitlines() #print(result) gno = 1 for i in range(len(result)): #print(result[i]) group = result[i].split(\":\") #列出組序 print(\"<a href='../g\"+str(gno)+\"'>第\"+str(gno)+\"組</a>:<br />\") #print(\"第\"+str(gno)+\"組:<br />\") #取 group 第2成員, 用逗點隔開納入數列後, 利用[:-1]去掉最後空白 #print(group[1].split(\",\")[:-1]) gmember = group[1].split(\",\")[:-1] for j in range(len(gmember)): #print(gmember[j]) print(\"<a href='../g\"+str(gno)+\"/\"+str(gmember[j])+\"'>\"+ \\ str(gmember[j])+\"</a> \") print(\"<br />\") gno = gno + 1","tags":"misc"}]};
